- GiftCardFunctions.swift

Code defining a class called "GiftCardFunctions" that contains two static functions: "getSeasonalGiftCards" and "getThankYouGiftCards". These functions return an array of "GiftCardModel" objects, which contain an ID, description, and image.

Both functions use a background thread to simulate retrieving data from a data store, and then they use the main thread to call the completion handler with the retrieved data.

The "getSeasonalGiftCards" function adds six "GiftCardModel" objects to an array, each with a different description and image. The "getThankYouGiftCards" function adds four "GiftCardModel" objects to an array, each with a different description and image.

The use of the @escaping keyword on the completion parameter indicates that the closure may be called after the function returns. This is necessary because the closure is used to pass data back to the calling code.

- GiftCardModel.swift

Code defining a struct called "GiftCardModel". The struct has three properties: "id", "description", and "image", all of which are initialized in the struct definition.

The "id" property is of type UUID, which is a unique identifier. The "description" property is a string that describes the gift card. The "image" property is an UIImage, which represents the image of the gift card.

The use of a struct in this context is appropriate since a gift card can be modeled as a self-contained object with a fixed set of properties. Additionally, the properties of the struct are defined as "var" to indicate that they can be mutated after the struct is initialized.

- AppDelegate.swift

This is Swift code for the "AppDelegate" class, which is the entry point for iOS applications. This class adopts the "UIApplicationDelegate" protocol, which defines the methods for responding to application lifecycle events.

The "AppDelegate" class has several methods that correspond to different states in the application lifecycle:

"application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)" is called when the application finishes launching. This method provides an opportunity to perform any necessary setup for the application.

"applicationWillResignActive(_)" is called when the application is about to become inactive. This can occur when the user receives a phone call or the app is interrupted in some other way. This method provides an opportunity to pause any ongoing tasks or disable timers.

"applicationDidEnterBackground(_)" is called when the application enters the background. This method provides an opportunity to release shared resources, save user data, and prepare the application for termination.

"applicationWillEnterForeground(_)" is called when the application is about to enter the foreground. This method provides an opportunity to undo any changes made when the application entered the background.

"applicationDidBecomeActive(_)" is called when the application becomes active. This method provides an opportunity to restart any tasks that were paused while the application was inactive.

"applicationWillTerminate(_)" is called when the application is about to terminate. This method provides an opportunity to save any data that needs to be preserved.

The "AppDelegate" class has a "window" property, which is a reference to the application's main window. The "@UIApplicationMain" attribute at the top of the file marks this class as the main entry point for the application.
